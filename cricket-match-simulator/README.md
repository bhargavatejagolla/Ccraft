# Cricket Match Simulation

## Overview
A C program that simulates a cricket match between two teams, tracking batting and bowling statistics. The simulation includes player performances, scoreboards, and match results.

## Features
- Team creation with customizable player names
- Innings simulation with ball-by-ball input
- Scoreboard display with detailed player statistics
- Automatic target calculation for second innings
- Match result declaration
- Memory management for player data

## Difficulty Level
- **Intermediate C Programming** (uses structures, pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and file I/O)

## Requirements
- C compiler (GCC recommended)
- Standard C libraries (stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, stdbool.h)

## Installation & Usage

### Compilation
```bash
gcc cricket_simulation.c -o cricket
```
## Game Flow
- Enter team names and player details

- First innings (Team 1 bats)

- Second innings (Team 2 chases target)

- Match result declaration
## Code Structure
### Key Data Structures
``` c
struct Player {
    char name[50];
    int runs;
    int balls;
    int fours;
    int sixes;
    int isOut;
    struct Player *prev;
    struct Player *next;
};

struct Team {
    char name[50];
    struct Player *head;
    int playerCount;
    int totalRuns;
    int wickets;
    float overs;
};
```
## Main Functions
- inputTeam() - Collects team information

- playInnings() - Simulates an innings

- printScoreboard() - Displays team statistics

- declareResult() - Determines match winner
